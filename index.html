1. Achievement - It will provide a proud feeling of having done something difficult but worthwhile.
<p>
2. Recognition -  This recognition should come from both their superiors and their peers.
<p>
3. The work itself -  The job or job course itself must be interesting, varied, and provide enough of a challenge to keep students motivated.
<p>
4. Responsibility - Students should “own” their work. They should hold themselves responsible for this completion and not feel as though they are being micromanaged.
